# Comic Shanns Mono Nerd Font With Ligatures

This repository is inspired by [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/192ebvy/ive_sinned_glued_together_comic_sans_and_ligatures/).

The fonts are made with the `ComicShannsMono Nerd Font` in [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and [Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) by following the [operations](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-script) step by step.

I did not modify the configs in `ligatures.py`. If you'd like to add or remove some ligatures, just do the same thing described above.
